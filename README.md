 Task Description: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

 ### Objective:
The goal of this task is to clean and prepare a raw dataset for analysis or modeling. The dataset used for this project is the **Disney+ Titles dataset**, which contains information about movies and TV shows available on the platform.

This task involves identifying and fixing common data issues such as:
- Missing values
- Duplicate records
- Inconsistent formatting
- Incorrect or inconsistent data types
- Unclear or messy column naming

### Tools Used:
- **Python** (Pandas library)
- **Google Colab** (for code execution and visualization)
- **GitHub** (for project submission and version control)

### Key Cleaning Steps:
- Inspected the dataset structure and missing data using `.isnull()`
- Filled or removed missing values where appropriate
- Removed duplicate rows
- Standardized inconsistent text formats (e.g., lowercase for type, title case for country names)
- Converted date columns into a consistent datetime format
- Renamed column headers to be lowercase and use underscores instead of spaces
- Verified and corrected data types (e.g., date columns as datetime)

By completing this task, we created a cleaned, structured dataset ready for further data analysis or visualization.
